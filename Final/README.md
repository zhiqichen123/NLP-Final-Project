# News Category Classifier, Articles Recommendation, and Authorship Identification
This project is a corpus analysis of HuffPost News from 2012 to 2018. This project was done for the course "Introduction to NLP with Python" at Brandeis University.

This project contains the following files:
* The `News_Category_Dataset_v2.json` is the raw data.
* The `Report.pdf` is a well-written report, including the results of statistical analyses, data visualizations, news category classifier, articles recommendation, and authorship identification.
* The `Statistical Analysis.ipynb` file generates brief text analysis on the short descriptions of news articles.
* The `Visualization.ipynb` script generates several visualizations such as pie chart, bar plot, and word clouds.
* The `NLP Final Project.py` file trains 6 models to predict categories of news. It also trains 4 models to recommend some news based on the piece being read. All programs can be executed from the terminal.
* The `Identify Authorship.py` file trains 12 models to identify who writes the articles based on the authors' writing styles.

This project requires the following libraries: 
* `nltk`
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `sklearn`
* `matplotlib`
* `wordcloud`
* `sys`
* `argparse`
* `re`
* `os`
* `math`
* `operator`
* `random`
* `json`
* `pickle`
* `timeit`
* `collections`
